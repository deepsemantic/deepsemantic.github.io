Welcome! My name is Cheng Wang. I am currently a research scientist in System and Machine Learning Group, NEC Laboratories Europe. Before that, I received my Dr.rer.nat degree from <a href="https://hpi.de/">Hasso-Plattner-Institute</a>, University of Potsdam in 2017. There, I was supervised by <a href="https://hpi.de/meinel/lehrstuhl.html">Prof. Dr. Christoph Meinel</a>, my research topic was "Multimodal Deep Learning". My research interests are machine (deep) learning and their applications to language and vision tasks, e.g., multimodal information retrieval, multimodal recommender systems. </p>
