<p align="justify"> Welcome! My name is Cheng Wang. I am currently an Applied Scientist at Amazon Alexa AI. Prior to that, I was a Research Scientist at Machine Learning Group, NEC Laboratories Europe. I received my Dr.rer.nat degree from <a href="https://hpi.de/">Hasso-Plattner-Institute</a>, University of Potsdam in 2017. There, I was supervised by <a href="https://hpi.de/meinel/lehrstuhl.html">Prof. Dr. Christoph Meinel</a>, my research topic was "Multimodal Deep Learning".  My research focuses are (1) machine (deep) learning methods, e.g, learning algorithms, sequence-to-sequence learning, representation learning, neural architectures, model optimization, and interpretability; (2) their applications to real-world tasks, e.g., information retrieval, recommender systems, natural language processing, computer vision and multimodal learning. I am particularly interested in Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and its related learning machines.
