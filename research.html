<h1>Deep Learning: Interpretability and Explainability</h1>
<p> Deep learning (i.e. deep neural network) has shown its superior performance in many area. However, interpreting deep learning models and explaining their prediction remain challenging.</p>

<br>
<br>
<h1>Multimodal Learning</h1>
<p> This research work is to design and implement deep learning models/architectures to multimodal data analysis, e.g. image associated with text description, video with audio information, text news accompanied with images et al.. The analysis of multimodal data can tell us different aspects of information conveyed by data. On the other hand, their combination gives us a more accurate knowledge and understanding of visual-textual or visual-auditory information</p>
